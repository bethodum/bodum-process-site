	<h3>Sticky Note Research</h3>
	<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/sticky-main.png" alt="Sticky note research" /></span>I started out with trying to grasp every individual and group that is involved in the process of FillWaterBottles.com. From organizing packing parties, locating people and groups in need, packing bottles, and trasnporting and distributing.</p>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/sticky-connection.png" height="300" width="30" alt="Sticky note research"/></span>Next, I specified every group that would possibly be related to the organization. Since FillWaterBottles.com is a global organization, there is a lot of involvement from vastly different groups. Schools in the US contribute help by having teams and clubs pack bottles. They are also great spaces for recruiting volunteers and interns. Schools across the globe are often easy to partner with to distribute bottles. Churches play a large roll in the work, and account for much of the volunteer hours. Small groups, youth groups, and even individual members play vital roles in different steps of the process; but churches as a whole help market the organization by word-of-mouth.</p>
