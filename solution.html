							<p>The CTA for my page is a rounded yellow box with text. This contrasts greatly from the primarily blue color scheme. I chose the rounded edges opposed to straight corners to increase the soft, playful feel of the organization. I wanted to grab attention without distracting from design, so the button itself is just a stroke line with text in the center.</p>

						<h2>Secondary Research</h2>

						<p>A similar mission and organization is Operation Christmas Child. 	This organization employs
							volunteers across the world to pack both practical and fun items in a shoebox to be
							delivered to vulnerable children.

							Their website has very clear tabs to click for information. Not only do they stand out against their background as a button, but they clearly describe the action being taken when
							they are pressed.

							Their “Get Involved” tab is divided into sections. This way, users can more easily find what
							they need, and be given information easily.

							The next organization I looked into is
							Samaritan’s Feet. This group collects shoes to be distributed to children in need. They
							start by giving users their story on the website. This information being given on the home
							page quickly tells the heart of the ministry.

							The website has uniform icons that express
							the values of the organization and the reasoning behind what they are doing. This provides a
							visual for users to grasp information quickly. Overall, the entirety of the website is
							broken down into easily understood sections. It begins with the story, then leads to more
							in-depth information on the subject, and ends with a call to action. </p>

						<h2>Client Interview</h2>
							<p>I was able to interview Katie Brady, the Director of Child Sponsorship at HHFM (the
								larger organization that encompasses FillWaterBottles.com) to talk about the
								organization. I learned through this conversation that their primary goal is
								discipleship with the individuals they are working to reach. When asked where she saw
								the most growth in the organization, Katie said, “During COVID, our team stretched
								themselves to find new and creative ways to reach our communities despite unique
								challenges.” Lastly, she mentioned that the typical form of connection for their
								organization is through social media, but they want to engage more with churches. </p>

							<h2>User Interview</h2>
							<p>Next, I interviewed a frequent user of the FillWaterBottles.com site. Caroline has
								volunteered with HHFM both locally in the United States and in Bolivia and Uganda. She
								heard about the organization through her church, and when asked about her usage of the
								website she noted that she typically gets her information from the organization's social
								media page out of convenience. She also noted that the website is playful and energetic,
								but too busy to get useful information.</p>
